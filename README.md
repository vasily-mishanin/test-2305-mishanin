### Test Challenge from 3205 Team

This is a simple fullstack web app on Typescript as a challenge task.
Tha app idea is simple - you search for a user by their email or/and phone number and get results below the search form.
I've made this app in two variants:

#### 1. Separate backend and frontend

- Server - Node JS on Express.js - /sever
- Client - React JS bundled with Vite - /client

To run local server (on http://localhost:5050):
from `/server` directory run the following scripts  
 `npm install`  
then  
`npm run dev`  
OR  
`npm run build`  
`npm start`

To run client:
from `/client` directory run the following scripts  
 `npm install`  
then  
`npm run dev` (on http://localhost:5173)

OR  
`npm run build`  
`npm run preview` (on http://localhost:4173)

#### 2. Fullstack app on Next.js 13 (with app router) and Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI - /users-next-js

To run the app (on http://localhost:3000):
from `/users-next-js` directory run the following scripts  
`npm install`  
then  
`npm run dev`  
OR  
`npm run build`  
`npm start`
